### Segmenting-Customers

#Introduction:

Welcome to the Customer Segmentation project, where we leverage RFM analysis to enhance marketing strategies for a chain of retail stores. This analysis aids in identifying and prioritizing customers based on their recency, frequency, and monetary engagement.

#Project Overview:

In this project, we conducted a customer segmentation analysis using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) scores. The dataset, while proprietary and sensitive, allowed us to derive meaningful insights without disclosing specific customer information.
